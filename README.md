## Why Enterprise MCP Servers?

While community MCP servers are perfect for experimentation and learning, enterprise environments demand production-grade reliability, security, and scalability. This curated collection provides battle-tested MCP servers designed specifically for:

- **Large Corporations** that need bank-level security and strict data protection
- **Banks & Financial Companies** that must follow strict financial regulations
- **Hospitals & Healthcare** that need to protect patient privacy and medical data
- **Government Agencies** that must keep sensitive data within their own facilities
- **Big Companies** that want to give AI access to thousands of employees safely

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI models to securely connect with local and remote resources through standardized servers. It extends AI capabilities by providing structured access to files, databases, APIs, and other contextual services—enabling both production-ready integrations and experimental functionality.
